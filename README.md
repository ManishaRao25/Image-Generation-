## How to Run

1. **GenAI_Image_Generation.ipynb** - The `ipynb` file contains the code used to generate the images using AI-based image generation techniques.

   To run this notebook, follow these steps:
   1. Clone the repository:  
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/ManishaRao25/Image-Generation.git
      cd genai-image-generation
      ```
   2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab:
      ```bash
      jupyter notebook GenAI_Image_Generation.ipynb
      ```
   3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to generate similar images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- Torch library

Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the notebook.

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Instructions:
- Replace the `ManishaRao25` in the clone command with your GitHub username.
- Upload the two images (`Screenshot 2024-09-23 185424.png` and `Screenshot 2024-09-23 191151.png`) to your GitHub repository so that the paths in the markdown can correctly display the images.

Once the images are uploaded and the notebook file is included in the repo, this `README.md` will ensure everything is documented and the images display correctly.
