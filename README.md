## How to Run

1. **GenAI_Image_Generation.ipynb** - The `ipynb` file contains the code used to generate the images using AI-based image generation techniques.

   To run this notebook, follow these steps:
   1. Clone the repository:  
      ```bash
      git clone https://github.com/ManishaRao25/Image-Generation-.git
      cd genai-image-generation
      ```
   2. Open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab:
      ```bash
      jupyter notebook GenAI_Image_Generation.ipynb
      ```
   3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to generate similar images.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Hugging Face Transformers library
- Torch library

Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the notebook.

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

### Instructions:
- Replace the `ManishaRao25` in the clone command with your GitHub username.
- Upload the two images to your GitHub repository so that the paths in the markdown can correctly display the images.

Once the images are uploaded and the notebook file is included in the repo, this `README.md` will ensure everything is documented and the images display correctly.
